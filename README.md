[Vaibhav Sagar](https://vaibhavsagar.com/) spent hours pairing with me to figure out how encode this question.
[opticron](https://github.com/opticron) made several useful suggestions.
[Dennis Yurichev](https://sat-smt.codes/) wrote the book that I spent at least a hundred hours reading to understand the Z3 SMT solver.
